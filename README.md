# hypertuna-relay-manager-client
a simple NOSTR client app for creating, joining, and managing your Hypertuna Relay instances

**Note:**

- This is an ongoing work-in-progress, to be used as the front-end of an integrated Hypertuna Relay Manager client application built on top of:
    - Hypertuna Relay Server (https://github.com/squip/hypertuna-relay-server)
    - Hypertuna Proxy Server (https://github.com/squip/hypertuna-proxy-server)
  
- Current state only supports the NOSTR client capabilities for peer discovery / web-of-trust / relay group admin features.
